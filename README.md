# seats_and_mounts--sailboat_adaptations
selection of seating and equipment mounting options, as well as transfer options, to meet the needs of different boats, sailors and scenarios

please propose approaches, primarily focusing on universal access/adaptive needs, to the following scenarios, primarily involving bluewater sailing.

## helm station seating
maintaining a proper watch from the helm station is a challenge for every sailor, and vessel design often introduces the following complications:
- Obstructed sight lines (masts, sails, coachroofs, dodgers, sprayhoods, typical crew positions)
- Noises masking sound signals (wind in rigging, waves against the hull, sail flapping)
- Cockpit confinement (helm station is low in most boats, and in many assumes the helm will cross the cockpit for various routine reasons, e.g. to be on the high side for righting moment, or to see past a close-hauled jib)

## transfer among crew positions

## transfer between dock and boat

## transfer between boats
between the main boat and dinghies tenders, launches, rescue vessels
