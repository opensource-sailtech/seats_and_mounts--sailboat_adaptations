# seats_and_mounts--sailboat_adaptations
selection of seating possibilities to meet the needs of different boats, sailors and scenarios

## helm station
maintaining a proper watch from the helm station is a challenge for every sailor, and vessel design often introduces the following complications:
- Obstructed sight lines (masts, sails, coachroofs, dodgers, sprayhoods, typical crew positions)
- Noises masking sound signals (wind in rigging, waves against the hull, sail flapping)
- Cockpit confinement (helm station is low in most boats, and in many assumes the helm will cross the cockpit for various routine reasons, e.g. to be on the high side for righting moment, or to see past a close-hauled jib)

please propose solutions, primarily with adaptive needs in mind, to the above concerns
